# Hello there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Sam

<p>
a web developer with a strong network administration background. Through my work as an IT specialist for system integration, I became a conceptual thinker with deep and broad knowledge in the areas of information technology and computer networking. For scripts I'm writing I primarily use React and Node.js.<br>
As a network administrator, it was always my dream to become a creative web developer, who implements and deploys websites, and my goal is to become a developer for both back-end and front-end sides. 
</p>
